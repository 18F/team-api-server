# team-api-server

Node.js server that imports and publishes updates to [Team
API](https://team-api.18f.gov/public/api/) data.

### <a name="config"></a>Generate and configure `team-api-config.json`

Run `team-api print-template > path/to/team-api-config.json` to generate a
`team-api-config.json` file. Edit this file to support your installation.

The template is a copy of the [`team-api-config.json`](./team-api-config.json)
from this repository, which is based on the actual configuration for the 18F
Team API server, and illustrates each of the following settings:

* **branch**: the repository branch from which to extract update information
* **buildPort**: the port on which the server will listen for `push` events to
  the team-api.18f.gov repo
* **updatePort**: the port on which the server will listen for updates to
  `.about.yml` files from other 18F repos
* **git**:  path to `git` on the host machine
* **ruby**: path to `ruby` on the host machine
* **workingDir**: path to the 18F/team-api.18f.gov repository clone on the
  host machine
* **updateScript**: path to the Ruby script used to process `.about.yml` file
  updates

## <a name="installation"></a>Installing the `team-api` server

Install the following if they are not yet present on your system:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 0.12.7 or higher;
  check with `node -v`
* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) version 2.2.3 or higher;
  check with `ruby -v`
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) version 1.9.1 or higher;
  check with `git --version`

For Ruby, we strongly recommend using a version manager such as
[rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) or [rvm](https://rvm.io/),
though this is not required.

`rsync` should already be installed on most UNIX-like systems, but the
`rsyncOpts` [configuration option](#config) may require adjustment,
particularly on OS X. You may wish to experiment with `rsync` manually to
determine which options suit you best.

With the correct Node.js, Ruby, and Git versions in place, run the following:

```sh
$ gem install jekyll bundler
$ npm install -g team-api-server forever
```
Finally, as the user on the host that will run the server,
[generate an SSH key to add to your GitHub
account](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/). A new key can
be generated by another team member should you leave the organization.


### Run the `team-api` server

After that, run the following to launch the server via
[Forever](https://www.npmjs.com/package/forever), where `/path/to/` and
`/usr/local/bin/` are replaced with the appropriate absolute paths:

```sh
$ forever start -l /path/to/team-api.log -a /usr/local/bin/team-api /path/to/team-api-config.json
```

You can find the absolute path to `team-api` by running `which team-api`.
